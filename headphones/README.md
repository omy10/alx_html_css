💻 Responsive Web Page Project
📄 Description
This project is a fully responsive website built using only HTML and CSS, based on a designer-provided mockup. It showcases fundamental frontend development skills including semantic HTML structure, CSS styling, layout techniques, and responsive design — without using any external libraries or JavaScript.

The website layout automatically adapts to various screen sizes, with a mobile-friendly version triggered at screen widths of 480px or less. All elements, including links and buttons, follow the specified interaction states and styling rules.
