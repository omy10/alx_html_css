💻 Responsive Web Page Project
📄 Description
This project is a fully responsive website built using only HTML and CSS, based on a designer-provided mockup. It showcases fundamental frontend development skills including semantic HTML structure, CSS styling, layout techniques, and responsive design — without using any external libraries or JavaScript.

The website layout automatically adapts to various screen sizes, with a mobile-friendly version triggered at screen widths of 480px or less. All elements, including links and buttons, follow the specified interaction states and styling rules.

🎯 Objectives
Recreate a designer’s web layout exactly as provided

Use pure HTML & CSS (no frameworks or JS)

Ensure responsive behavior and accessibility

Comply with styling instructions such as:

Link :hover and :active color: #FF6565

Button :hover and :active: opacity: 0.9

Content width capped at 1000px, centered on the page

📱 Responsiveness
The layout adapts seamlessly to screen sizes with:

Desktop layout (above 480px)

Mobile layout (480px and below)

Responsive images and text

Adjusted layout spacing for smaller devices

📦 Technologies Used
HTML5

CSS3

Media Queries for responsiveness

CSS Flexbox/Grid for layout structure

🚫 Restrictions
❌ No external CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind)

❌ No JavaScript

✅ Custom styles only (written from scratch)

✅ Follows accessibility best practices

🧪 How to Run the Project
Clone or download the repository

Open the index.html file in any web browser

Resize the browser window to test responsiveness (mobile view activates at 480px width)
